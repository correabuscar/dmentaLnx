# dmentaLnx  (formerly known as demLinks)

-dmentaLnx is (a work in progress) ... something ... to improve accessibility... (FIXME)  
Think replacing RAM(random access memory) with graphs(edges&nodes) and use that as a foundation for building up systems and subsystems (stacked CPUs+databases?)  
The project name is temporary.

It should allow for storing/retrieving/handling/etc. omniteric knowledge :))  
"Omniteric knowledge is that which remains open and accessible to all people depending upon their own ambition and enthusiasm to discover." - src: The Duodoxy: The Principles of The Logical Cosmos by Cometan (see google)  
TODO: good definition, but should I use "exoteric" instead? "intended for or likely to be understood by the general public.", "Exoteric refers to knowledge that is outside, and independent from, a person's experience and can be ascertained by anyone (related to common sense). " - src: google and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoteric

## Usage

FIXME: nothing here yet



## Authors

Currently almost(?) everything (all functions, files, text) in this repository are made by me Emanuel Czirai and I've dedicated this repository to public domain. I've been using different nicks over time, but they're all me.  

This readme template is originally from: https://github.com/davispuh/CLI-Console/blob/master/README.md

## Unlicense

![Copyright-Free](https://unlicense.org/pd-icon.png)

It means you can copy, modify, distribute and include in your own work/code, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.

[About Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/)
 
This kinda explains the why: https://github.com/twolfson/twolfson.com/blob/c59f67c1336be5c5788842539ce8679e54e9845d/articles/unlicense-all-the-things.md
 
 If you're wondering why CC0 might be preferred? Who knows: https://github.com/FailMan3D/shsls-spacecraft/blob/7cff5b4b6405f242749e8787e595d463dbbd67a2/LICENSE.note Also see the previous link(on the why).
 
I also added CC0 (in the file LICENSE) which should be the same thing(=public domain)! So for those who have a problem with Unlicense, they can pick CC0. Assume this is released under both(or either) - the result is the same: public domain! So pick the one you're confortable with and assume this is released under it. There! Free enough??! ;-) Have fun!  


Actually, for even more freedom, I'm releasing this also under the terms of the MIT License and/or the Apache License 2.0  
TODO/FIXME: contributing needs changing due to this ^
